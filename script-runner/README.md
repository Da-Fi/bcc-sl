# script-runner

This module contains scripts to perform tests at the cluster level - running clusters of nodes, issuing update proposals to them, restarting them, etc. Some of the code here was extracted from the `auxx` package and reworked.

### Usage

See the `stack-gui` and `stack-test` scripts which contain usage commands.

### Testing SBFT

`script-runner` launches nodes using the `dev:` key of `lib/configuration.yaml`. We can start in SBFT era by applying a patch such as
```
diff --git a/lib/configuration.yaml b/lib/configuration.yaml
index b55039730b..f67e581929 100644
--- a/lib/configuration.yaml

```
and then running a test e.g. `cd script-runner && ./stack-test test4.1` which ensures that we can issue update proposals and see them adopted in SBFT era.
